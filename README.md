# LangSeed
## Overview
A set of Dockerfiles for your operating system of choice to help create a flexible development environment

The goal is to allow you to easily install any version of any language that you want to work with

The first layer of options is to allow you to install language version managers (e.g. pyenv, nvm,  rvm, etc)

The second layer of options allows you to pre-install a selected language version (e.g. 3.10.2 of python, lts/gallium of node, etc)

After that, code crazy, code nuts
